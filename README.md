# Todo List Website

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll build a **Todo List Web Application** using **React**. This project helps in understanding state management, event handling, and working with lists in React. It’s perfect for beginners looking to strengthen their skills in React development.

## Project Overview

The Todo List application allows users to add, mark as completed, and remove tasks. It offers a clean interface for managing daily tasks. This project showcases how React can be used to manage the state of a simple yet dynamic application.

## Features

- **Add New Task**: Users can add tasks to the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as done.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Persists tasks across page reloads using `localStorage`.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component state.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For the core logic and functionality.
